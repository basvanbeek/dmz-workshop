# Overview
Every single application within the mesh runs with an Envoy proxy sidecar, whether it is a Kubernetes pod or a legacy VM.  Envoy provides an extensible framework for altering the configuration and behavior of the Envoy proxy in the form of filters.  Though there are a few options for creating Envoy filters, [WebAssembly (WASM)](https://www.tetrate.io/blog/wasm-outside-the-browser/) provides a high-performance option with a SDK that allows you to author your code in a number of languages, compiling down to WASM binaries.  In this lab we will configure a simple filter that modifies HTTP request/response headers.

## Configure the Envoy Filter
It is beyond the scope of this workshop to explain the ins and outs of creating extensions in WASM.  We will use a fairly trivial extension in this example.  You can view the source code in the `06-Envoy/wasm/header-filter` folder (see `main.go`).  For this example we already have a precompiled WASM binary available for us to use: `06-Envoy/wasm/header-filter/main.wasm`

There are a few ways to load a binary into the Envoy proxy, for instance from a remote download location.  However, for simplicity we will use a `ConfigMap` that gets mounted into a volume on the Envoy sidecar proxy.

- First we need to create the `ConfigMap` that contains our binary.  We will be configuring this in the Public Cloud East cluster, our insecure application, so ensure that your kubecontext is pointed to the public east cluster.  Then use the kubectl CLI to create the config map from a file:

```bash
kubectl create cm http-filter-example -n $PREFIX-demo-insecure --from-file=06-Envoy/wasm/header-filter/main.wasm
```
- Next we will patch our frontend deployment to load data in the config map into a container volume:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment frontend -n $PREFIX-demo-insecure --patch "$(cat 06-Envoy/patch.yaml)" 
```

This will force a rolling restart of our frontend pod.  Inspect the file `06-Envoy/patch.yaml`.  You'll note that patch is adding a few annotations to the Envoy sidecar pods this deployment creates that will create a userVolume at a specific location, `/var/local/lib/wasm-filters`, that contains the binary data of our `ConfigMap`.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/userVolume: '[{"name":"wasmfilters-dir","configMap": {"name":"http-filter-example"}}]'
        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: '[{"mountPath":"/var/local/lib/wasm-filters","name":"wasmfilters-dir"}]'
```

- Lastly, we need to create the `EnvoyFilter`, which is the configuration object that loads the extension into Envoy and places it in a specific location in the filter chain execution.
```bash
envsubst < 06-Envoy/filter.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

If you inspect the file `06-Envoy/filter.yaml` you'll be able to gather the general gist of what is taking place.  First, we are instructing Envoy to execute our filter to the sidecar's `http_connection_manager`.

```yaml
spec:
  configPatches:
  - applyTo: HTTP_FILTER
    match:
      context: SIDECAR_INBOUND
      listener:
        filterChain:
          filter:
            name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
```

Next we'll see the actual extension configuration.  Though fairly verbose, this configuration is simply telling Envoy to load a WASM extension named `headers-extension` from the local volume `/var/local/lib/wasm-filters/main.wasm`.  This is the volume that we previously mounted using the annotations we *patched* into our deployment.  This extension adds an arbitrary set of response headers to all requests which are configured in the `configuration` section of our filter.  In our case it is a single header named `Tetrate` with a value of `This came from my custom EnvoyFilter!!!!`.

```yaml
patch:
  operation: INSERT_BEFORE
  value:
    name: headers-extension
    typed_config:
      "@type": type.googleapis.com/udpa.type.v1.TypedStruct
      type_url: type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.wasm.v3.Wasm
      value:
        config:
          vm_config:
            vm_id: headers-extension-vm
            runtime: envoy.wasm.runtime.v8
            code:
              local:
                filename: /var/local/lib/wasm-filters/main.wasm
          configuration:
            "@type": type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue
            value: |
              Tetrate=This came from my custom EnvoyFilter!!!!
```

- Now we can test using a simple `curl` command to the frontend application running in the insecure cluster:

```bash
curl -v -X HEAD https://insecure.public.$PREFIX.cloud.zwickey.net/  
```

You'll note in the verbose response you see the request and response headers in the HTTP `HEAD` request, and we now see our new `tetrate` header added by the `EnvoyFilter`:
```bash
< HTTP/2 200 
< date: Fri, 10 Sep 2021 03:19:26 GMT
< content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
< x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 2
< tetrate: This came from my custom EnvoyFilter!!!!
< server: istio-envoy
< 
* Connection #0 to host insecure.public.test.cloud.zwickey.net left intact
* Closing connection 0
```
